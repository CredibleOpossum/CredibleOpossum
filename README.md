## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zander, a passionate programmer and chess player, with a love for writing efficient, low-level code. I primarily work with Rust, but I'm also proficient in C and C++. As an enthusiast of the Linux ecosystem, I exclusively use Linux in my daily workflow, currently running [Fedora 41 Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/).

In addition to these, I find great joy in reverse engineering and memory hacking. Feel free to explore one of my projects, the BuriedBournes Save Editor, on [GitHub](https://github.com/CredibleOpossum/buriedbournes-save-editor).
